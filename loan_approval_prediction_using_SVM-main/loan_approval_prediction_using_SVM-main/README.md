# loan_approval_prediction_using_SVM

Loan approval prediction using Support Vector Machine Supervised Machine learning algorithm
- Using SVM algorithm, I achieved an accuracy of 85%.


Overview:
This project is designed to predict loan approval statuses based on various customer attributes. Using machine learning algorithms, it helps financial institutions assess loan applications more efficiently by identifying high-risk profiles and automating parts of the decision-making process.

Features:
Machine Learning Models: Trained on historical data to predict loan approvals.
Data Analysis: Exploration and visualization of key features influencing loan approval decisions.
Accuracy Measurement: Evaluated model accuracy using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project includes information like applicant income, education, marital status, loan amount, and more.
